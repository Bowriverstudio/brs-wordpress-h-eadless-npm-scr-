# Conventional Commits Guide

Conventional Commits is a commit naming convention that helps teams to have an automatic and conventional commit naming strategy. Our project uses the `git-conventional-commits` tool to ensure that every commit message adheres to the Conventional Commits specification.

## Commit Types

When making a commit, start the message with one of the following types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `perf`: A performance improvement
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `build`: Changes to the build system or external dependencies
- `ops`: Operational changes or adjustments
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, chores, or updates that don't fit other categories
- `merge`: Merging branches or code
- `revert`: Reverting changes

## Example

If you're adding a new button feature:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add a new button component"
```
